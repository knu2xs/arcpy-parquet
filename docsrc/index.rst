ArcPy-Parquet Documentation
=============================================================================================================

ArcPy-Parquet is a Python module and ArcGIS Pro Python Toolbox (``./arcgis/ArcPy-Parquet-Tools.pyt``) 
facilitating conversion between ArcGIS Feature Classes in a Geodatabase and Parquet datasets. The Python
package can be used autonomously (without the ArcGIS Python Toolbox) for automated data export or ingestion 
tasks.
